# LocationApp
Simple Android app that displays the position of a tag inside a Ultra Wideband Real Time Localization System based on decawave's DWM1001-Devkits

This app was tested with a Samsung Galaxy S8 running Android 9. 
Note: In order to use this app, your UWB network must have already been configured prior to use of this app.
For this, use decawaves RTLS Manager for example or connect your dev kits via USB and use UART shell mode.
